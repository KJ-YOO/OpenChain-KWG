## What is the OpenChain Specification?
![Specification](spec.png) 

The OpenChain Specification is a 12-page standard specification that defines key requirements for open source compliance, and is designed to be suitable for companies in all fields regardless of the size or industry of the enterprise. In December 2020, the [OpenChain Specification 2.1](https://www.openchainproject.org/contribute-to-the-standard) was released, describing six requirements that companies must perform to achieve open source compliance and defining a list of verification materials that can prove that companies are doing so.

1. Program Foundation
2. Relevant Tasks Defined and Supported
3. Open Source Content Review and Approval
4. Compliance Artifact Creation and Delivery
5. Understanding Open Source Community Engagements
6. Adherence to the Specification Requirements

If you are new to open source compliance, you can improve your level by meeting the requirements of this OpenChain Specification one by one.

## Specification translation policy
